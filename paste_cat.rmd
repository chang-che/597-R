When you paste something and don't assign it to anything, it becomes a character variable that is print-ed using print.default, the default method for character, hence the quotes, etc. You can look at the help for print.default for understanding how to modify what the output looks like.

print.default will not evaluate escape characters such as \n within a character string.
```{r}
paste(letters[1:3], c(1,2,3), collapse = '-')
class(paste(letters[1:3], c(1,2,3), collapse = '-'))
paste(letters[1:3], c(1,2,3), collapse = NULL)
paste(letters[1:3], c(1,2,3), collapse = '-', sep = '=')
paste(letters[1], c(1,2,3), collapse = '-', sep = '=')

```


cat will not return anything, it will just output to the console or another connection.
Concatenate and Print

Description

Outputs the objects, concatenating the representations. cat performs much less conversion than print.
```{r}
cat()
```

```{r}
x = rep(NA, 10)
x[1:3] = 1
x
```
